Abstract:
The Cardano Community currently relies on centralized platforms like GitHub for code collaboration. This CPS proposes the exploration of decentralizing code collaboration using Radicle, a peer-to-peer code collaboration stack built on Git, and incentivizing community members to seed code repositories via Cardano-node.

Problem:
The Cardano Community's dependence on centralized code hosting platforms like GitHub poses risks to the community's autonomy and decentralization principles. Centralized platforms can be vulnerable to censorship, data breaches, and single points of failure, which can hinder the community's ability to collaborate and innovate.

Use cases:
1. Community-driven code collaboration: Radicle enables community members to collaborate on code repositories in a decentralized manner, ensuring that the community retains control over its codebase.
2. Incentivizing pro-social behavior: Providing rewards for seeding code repositories via Cardano-node can encourage community members to contribute to the decentralization of code collaboration, promoting a self-sovereign collaboration network.
3. Improved security and autonomy: Decentralizing code collaboration using Radicle can enhance the security and autonomy of the Cardano Community, reducing reliance on centralized platforms and mitigating associated risks.

Goals:
1. Explore the feasibility of integrating Radicle with Cardano-node to enable decentralized code collaboration.
2. Design a reward mechanism to incentivize community members to seed code repositories via Cardano-node.
3. Develop a governance framework to ensure the decentralization and autonomy of the community's code collaboration processes.

Open Questions:
1. How can the Cardano Community ensure the scalability and usability of Radicle for decentralized code collaboration?
2. What types of rewards and incentives can be offered to community members for seeding code repositories via Cardano-node?
3. How can the community balance the trade-offs between decentralization, security, and usability in the implementation of Radicle and the reward mechanism?
